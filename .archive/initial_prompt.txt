I want to make a small device to track the GPS location of a locomotive when it traverses a rail network.
I am quite familiar with using microcontroller boards such as ESP32 boards. The device must periodically
log the position and transmit it to a central company server database. The system must be expandable to
include many such devices in future. The idea is to make interactive dashboards from the data gathered from
the devices to track the entire fleet in real time. The data transmission from the device to the server
can be done using GPRS, LoRa and satellite (if feasible). Will satellite communication be possible with
standard microcontrollers, and if so does it make financial sense in the bigger scheme of this project?
There are areas on the network that do not have cellular signal, how to approach these areas? I will have
access to 110V or DC supply to power the device. Are there such off-the-shelf devices available on the market?
Is it worth it to develop it by myself? If the development is feasible, please provide all the components
that you think I will need with a basic assembly/configuration guide. check the suite of lilygo t-sim options
to see if it would make sense to use one of these options.
